After the last activation attempt ({{< ref "2024-06-20-Operating-report-POTA" >}}) where my antenna's insulator broke, I have received a replacement part from the manufaturer, this held up a lot better! I made more radials from my [DX10](https://dxcommander.com/product/dx10-antenna-wire/) wire which was a lot easier to deploy.
